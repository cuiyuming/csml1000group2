# Introduction
Melbourne is currently experiencing a housing bubble (some experts say it may burst soon). Maybe someone can find a trend or give a prediction? Which suburbs are the best to buy in? Which ones are value for money? Where's the expensive side of town? And more importantly where should I buy a 2 bedroom unit?

There are three parts to my script as follows:

* Feature engineering
* Missing value imputation
* Prediction!

```
# Load packages
library('ggplot2') # visualization
library('ggthemes') # visualizsation
library('scales') # visualization
library('dplyr') # data manipulation
library('mice') # imputation
```

raw <- read.csv('./data/raw/Melbourne_housing_FULL.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)
